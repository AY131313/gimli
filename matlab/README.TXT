GIMLab - GIMLi MatLab toolboxes

Similar to the python directory, this matlab directory provides functions around GIMLi.
However, there are no direct bindings, only file input/export and plotting functions.
Formerly, the functions have been organized in the DCMatLab repository.
The functions are organized in several toolboxes:

base    - base functions like matrix input/output, string representation, numerical base
eqsolve - equation solvers for different kinds, mostly for least squares problems
mesh    - functions for mesh input/output and manipulation
plot    - plotting functions from 1d to 3d
poly    - import, export and manipulation of PLC' (poly file) for mesh input
trans   - transformation functions
