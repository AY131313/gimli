  title = {{F}ast inversion of large-scale magnetic data using wavelet transforms
	and a logarithmic barrier method},
  journal = {Geophys. J. Int.},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {152},
  pages = {251-265},
  abstract = {In this paper wavelet transforms and a logarithmic barrier method
	are applied to the inversion of large-scale magnetic data to recover
	a 3-D distribution of magnetic susceptibility. The fast wavelet transform
	is used, along with thresholding the small wavelet coefficients,
	to form a sparse representation of the sensitivity matrix. The reduced
	size of the resultant matrix allows the solution of large problems
	that are otherwise intractable. The compressed matrix is used to
	carry out fast forward modelling by performing matrix-vector multiplications
	in the wavelet domain. The reduction in CPU time is directly proportional
	to the compression ratio of the matrix. A second important feature
	of the algorithm used here is the use of an interior-point method
	of optimization to enforce positivity constraints. In this approach,
	the positivity is incorporated into the inversion by a sequence of
	non-linear optimizations approximated by truncated Newton steps.
	At the heart of the algorithm, a linear system of equations is solved.
	The conjugate gradient technique has been used as the basic solver
	to take the advantage of the efficient forward modelling offered
	by the sparse matrix representation. Overall, the combination of
	wavelet transforms, interior point optimization and conjugate gradient
	solutions readily allows us to solve magnetic inverse problems that
	have a few hundred thousand parameters and tens of thousands of data.},
