Here are the codes discussed in the tutorial.
They are small applications for illustrating how the library is used.
Mostly corresponding applications with many options are located in the apps directory.
Additionally to the cpp files, cbp (CodeBlocks project) files are provided for easier build.
Please 
1. polyfit - A simple example: introduction to the inversion
2. dc1d - General concepts using DC 1d inversion: different meshes, regions and transformations
3. Enhanced techniques: MT inversion for amplitudes and phases,
4. Joint inversion techniques: Classical JI, Block JI, Structural JI and petrophysical JI
5. Inversion templates: Structural JI, Timelapse, Rollalong,
