Here are the codes discussed in the tutorial.
They are small applications for illustrating how the library is used.
Mostly corresponding applications with many options are located in the apps directory.
Additionally to the cpp files, cbp (CodeBlocks project) files are provided for easier build.

polyfit0.cpp: implementation of an own forward operator (polynomial function)
polyfit1.cpp: enhancement of polyfit0 by jacobian matrix (instead of brute force)
