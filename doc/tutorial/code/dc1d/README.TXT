Here are the codes discussed in the tutorial.
They are small applications for illustrating how the library is used.
Mostly corresponding applications with many options are located in the apps directory.
Additionally to the cpp files, cbp (CodeBlocks project) files are provided for easier build.
All examples use a direct current 1d inversion.

dc1dsmooth: smooth 1d inversion with predefined thickness 
dc1dblock: block 1d inversion with resistivity and thickness
dc1dsmooth-struct: incorporation of structural information (ground water level)
dc1dsmooth-region: region technique (one above and one below ground water level)

There is a synthetic date file based on a four-layer case with resistivities of
100, 500, 20, 1000 Ohmm and thicknesses of 0.5 3.5 6 metres with AB/2 values of
1 to 100 m in the file sond1-100.ves.
