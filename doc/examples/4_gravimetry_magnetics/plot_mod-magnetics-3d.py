3D magnetics modelling and inversion
------------------------------------

Based on the synthetic model of Li & Oldenburg (1996), we demonstrate 3D
inversion of magnetic data.

In the following, we will build the model, create synthetic data, and do
inversion using a depth-weighting function as outlined in the paper.

"""

# We first import the usual libraries numpy and pygimli
import numpy as np
import pygimli as pg
from pygimli.viewer import pv
from pygimli.physics.gravimetry import MagneticsModelling

# %%%
# The grid is 1 km by 1km by 500m with a spacing of 50m.
#

dx = 50
x = np.arange(0., 1001, dx)
y = np.arange(0., 1001, dx)
z = np.arange(0., 501, dx)
grid = pg.createGrid(x, y, z)
print(grid)

# %%%
# We create a 3D matrix that is later filled as vector into the grid. The
# model consists of zeros and patches of 5x6 cells per depth slice that
# are shifted by one cell for subsequent cells.
#

v = np.zeros((len(z)-1, len(y)-1, len(x)-1))
for i in range(7):
    v[1+i, 11-i:16-i, 7:13] = 0.05

grid["synth"] = v.ravel()

# %%%
# We show the model making use of the pyvista package that can be called
# py ``pg.show``. The mesh itself is shown as wireframe, the anomaly is
# plotted as surface plot using a threshold filter. After the first call
# with ``hold=True``, the plotter is used to draw any subsequent plots
# that can also be slices or clips. Moreover, the camera position is set
# so that the vertical axis is going downwards (x is Northing and y is
# Easting as common in magnetics).
#

# %%%
# For the computation of the total field, we define the global magnetic
# field using the IGRF (total field, inclination and declination) settings
# given in the paper. Any global field can also be retrieved by the
# ``pyIGRF`` module.
#

F, I, D = 50000e-9, 75, 25
H = F * np.cos(np.deg2rad(I))
X = H * np.cos(np.deg2rad(D))
Y = H * np.sin(np.deg2rad(D))
Z = F * np.sin(np.deg2rad(I))
igrf = [D, I, H, X, Y, Z, F]

py, px = np.meshgrid(x, y)
px = px.ravel()
py = py.ravel()
points = np.column_stack((px, py, -np.ones_like(px)*20))

# The forward operator
cmp = ["TFA"]
fop = MagneticsModelling(grid, points, cmp, igrf)
model = pg.Vector(grid.cellCount(), 1.0)
response = fop.response(grid["synth"])

vals = response * 1e9
mm = np.max(np.abs(vals))
pg.plt.scatter(px, py, c=vals, cmap="bwr", vmin=-mm, vmax=mm);

# %%%
# Depth weighting
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# In the paper of Li & Oldenburg, they propose a depthweighting of the
# constraints with the formula
#
# .. math::
#
#
#    w_z = \frac{1}{(z+z_0)^{3/2}}
#

# depth weighting
bz = np.array([b.center().z() for b in grid.boundaries() if not b.outside()])
z0 = 25
wz = 10 / (bz+z0)**1.5
fop.region(0).setConstraintWeights(wz)

# %%%
# Just like in the paper, the data are contaminated with an error model of
# 2% plus 1nT.
#

err = 0.01
noise_level = 1e-9
data = np.array(response)
relError = noise_level / np.abs(data) + err
data *= np.random.randn(*data.shape)*relError + 1.0

# %%%
# Inversion
# ~~~~~~~~~
#
# The inversion is rather straightforward using the standard inversion
# framework.
#

# run inversion
inv = pg.Inversion(fop=fop, verbose=True)  # , debug=True)
# inv.setRegularization(correlationLengths=[100, 100, 50])
# inv.setRegularization(limits=[0, 0.07])  # to limit values
startModel = pg.Vector(grid.cellCount(), 0.001)
invmodel = inv.run(data, relError, lam=100., startModel=1e-3, verbose=True)
grid["inv"] = invmodel

# %%%
# For showing the model, we again use the threshold filter with a value of
# 0.02. For comparison with the synthetic model, we plot the latter as
# wireframe.
#

ftr = dict(value=0.02, scalars="synth")
pl, _ = pg.show(grid, label="synth", style="wireframe",
                filter={"threshold": ftr}, hold=True)
ftr = dict(value=0.02, scalars="inv")
pv.drawMesh(pl, grid, label="inv", style="surface",
            filter={"threshold": ftr})
pl.camera_position = "yz"
pl.camera.roll = 90
pl.camera.azimuth = 180
pl.show()

# %%%
# The model can nicely outline the top part of the anomalous body, but not
# its depth extend.
#
# We compare the data and model response by scatter plots:
#

fig, ax = pg.plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(12, 5), sharex=True, sharey=True)
vals = data * 1e9
mm = np.max(np.abs(vals))
ax[0].scatter(px, py, c=vals, cmap="bwr", vmin=-mm, vmax=mm);
ax[1].scatter(px, py, c=inv.response*1e9, cmap="bwr", vmin=-mm, vmax=mm);

# %%%
# Alternatively, we can also plot the error-weighted misfit.
#

misfit = (inv.response*1e9-vals) / (relError * np.abs(data) * 1e9)
pg.plt.scatter(py, px, c=misfit, cmap="bwr", vmin=-3, vmax=3);
