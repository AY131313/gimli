Incorporating additional constraints as equations
=================================================
Sometimes we have additional information on the model that can be expressed in
form of an equation. Let us consider a simple vertical electrical sounding
(VES) that is inverted for a four-layer case with unknown layer thicknesses.

Assume we know the depth of the layer boundary, e.g. from a borehole, in this
case between the third and fourth layer be :math:`z_2`. So we can formulate this
by an equation :math:`d_1+d_2+d_3=z_2`. This equation can be added to the inverse
problem in the style of Lagrangian, i.e. by an additional regularization term.

We use the LSQR inversion framework as used by Wagner et al. (2019) to
constrain the sum of water, ice, air and rock fraction to be 1.
