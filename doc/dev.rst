GitHub notes for core developers
================================

Contributing to the code
------------------------

.. note::

    These steps are only relevant, if you have write privileges to the main
    GitHub repository. A more general contribution guide will follow soon.

1. Clone the GIMLi repository:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/gimli-org/gimli gimli-src && cd gimli-src

You should be on the master branch by default. Check by calling *git status*.
GIMLi encourages developers to keep the *master branch* clean. So please use
the default development branch called *dev*. Save `this script
<https://gist.github.com/florian-wagner/0be0b09bbabec6791ed3>` in .git/hooks
for automatic warnings in case you are about to push to the master branch.

2. Checkout the the dev branch:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git checkout dev

3. Make changes in your favorite editor.

4. Add new files to the staging area:

    .. code-block:: bash

       git add new_file1 new_file2

5. Make a commit with a *meaningful* message:

    .. code-block:: bash

       git commit -a -m "Added important new feature."

6. Pull the latest developments from GitHub:

    .. code-block:: bash

       git pull

7. Push to the origin development branch:

    .. code-block:: bash

       git push origin dev

Note that if you are on the `dev` branch, a `git push` should suffice, but the
command above is more explicit about the branch which should be pushed.

Version numbering
-----------------

Following the PEP conventions, pygimli holds a `__version__` string.

.. code-block:: python

    import pygimli as pg
    print(pg.__version__)
    v0.9-0-gf5a6772-modified

This string consists of:

    *Last git tag*-*Number of commits since last tag*-*last commit hash*

The string has a *-modified* suffix if pygimli has uncommitted changes.

To produce a new version, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    git tag -a -m "First official release" "v1.0" # tags last commit as v1.0
    git push --tags # pushes tags to GitHub


Read api documentation from shell:

.. code-block:: bash

  python -c "import pygimli as pg; help(pg.test)

Coding rules
------------

* All names should be literally and in CamelShape style.

* Classes starts with Upper Case Letter.

* Members and Methods allways starts with Lower Case Letter.

* All class member (self.member) need to be initialized in the Constructor.

* (uglyÂ²) Do not use multi initialize in one line, e.g., a, b, c = 0, 0, 0

Function behaviour by name:
...........................

.. code-block:: python

  createFOO(...)

Allways needs to return an instance of FOO.

.. code-block:: python

  showFOO(Bar, ...)

Allways opens a window or optionaly use a given Axes to show us Bar as Foo.

.. code-block:: python

  drawFOO(ax, Bar...)

Allways need an Axes ax and draws Bar as Foo in this Axes

Use pylint or prospector to improve code quality.

.. _sec:coding_guidelines:

Code Quality
------------

We use: (You can find exceptions in .landscape.yml)

* pep8
* pep257
* pylint
* pyflake

.. _sec:testing:

Testing
-------

Run api examples from shell:

.. code-block:: bash

  python -c "import pygimli as pg; pg.test(pg.meshtools.createCircle)"

Run a specific test from shell.

.. code-block:: bash

  python -c "import pygimli; from pygimli.physics.petro.resistivity import *; test_Archie()"

Run pylint from shell to check code:

.. code-block:: bash

    pylint --rcfile $GIMLIROOT/.pylintrc file.py

Run prospector to check code like landscape.io do:

.. code-block:: bash

    prospector --profile=$GIMLIROOT/.prospector.yml file.py
