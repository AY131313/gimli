Regularization - concepts explained
-----------------------------------

In geophysical inversion, we minimize the data objective functional as
the L2 norm of the misfit between data $d$ and the forward
response $f$ of the model $m$, weighted by the data error
$\epsilon$:

.. math:: \Phi_d = \sum\limits_i^N \left(\frac{d_i-f_i(m)}{\epsilon_i}\right)^2=\|W_d(d-f(m))\|^2

As this minimization problem is non-unique and ill-posed, we introduce a
regularization term $\Phi$, weighted by a regularization parameter
$\lambda$:

.. math:: \Phi = \Phi_d + \lambda \Phi_m

The regularization strength $\lambda$ should be chosen so that the
data are fitted within noise, i.e. $\chi^2=\Phi_d/N=1$.

In the term $\Phi-m$ we put our expectations to the model, e.g. to
be close to any prior model. In many cases we do not have much
information and aim for the smoothest model that is able to fit our
data. We decribe it by the operator $W_m$:

.. math:: \Phi_m=\|W_m (m-m_{ref})\|^2

The regularization operator is defined by some constraint operator
$C$ weighted by some weighting function $w$ so that
$W_m=\mbox{diag}(w) C$. The operator $C$ can be a discrete
smoothness operator, or the identity to keep the model close to the
reference model $m_{ref}$.

# We start with importing the numpy, matplotlib and pygimli libraries

# %%%
# Regularisation drives the model where the data are too weak to constrain
# the model. In order to explain different kinds of regularization (also
# called constraints), we use a very simple mapping forward operator: The
# values at certain positions are picked.
#

from pygimli.frameworks import PriorModelling

# %%%
# Implementation 1. determine the indices where the cells are
#
# ::
#
#    ind = [mesh.findCell(po).id() for po in pos]

# 2. forward response: take the model at indices
#
# ::
#
#    response = model[ind]

# 3. Jacobian matrix

# ::

#    J.resize(len(ind), mesh.cellCount())
#    for i, n in enumerate(self.ind):
#        self.J.setVal(i, n, 1.0)

# Geostatistic regularization
# ---------------------------

# %%%
# The idea is that not only neighbors are correlated to each other but to
# have a wider correlation by using an operator

# Take-away messages
# ==================
#
# -  regularization drives the model where data are weak
# -  think and play with your assumptions to the model
# -  there are several predefined options
# -  geostatistic regularization can be superior
#
#    -  it is mesh-independent
#    -  it better fills the data gaps (e.g.Â 3D inversion of 2D profiles)
#
