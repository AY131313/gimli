Tutorials
=========

Learn how pyGIMLi can be used for modelling and inversion. The listed tutorials
with increasing complexity start with basic functionality such as mesh
generation and visualization and dive into the generalized modelling and
inversion concepts including managers and frameworks. Check out the
:ref:`chapt:examples` for more specialized demonstrations and interesting case
studies.

The geoscience software developer group 
`Software underground <https://softwareunderground.org>`_ (SWUNG)
hosts yearly Transform meetings. We joined in 2021 and 2022 and provided tutorials
(videos on the `SWUNG youtube channel <https://www.youtube.com/@SoftwareUnderground>`_) 
accompagnied by Jupyter notebooks 
(`Transform2021 <https://github.com/gimli-org/transform2021>`_ and
`Transform2022 <https://github.com/gimli-org/transform2022>`_).
Additionally, there has been a pyGIMLi webinar in the SEG webinar series 
Near-Surface Geophysics - Open-Source Software 
(`YouTube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbLGbSEWOSw&list=PLEIS8l89JCa2EKsWLjkOsfzvua1tspOh->`_)
covering some newer features
