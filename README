#### Example Installation on Vanilla Debian ####

First install some of the necessary stuff.
For sure you will need subversion to get the source files and some things for the tool-chain

    sudo apt-get install subversion git cmake

    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev

Optional install useful stuff:

    sudo apt-get install libcppunit-dev libprocps0-dev

    sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

    sudo apt-get install doxygen

Create a directory for your installation, e.g., $HOME/src

    mkdir -p ~/src
    cd src
    mkdir -p gimli
    cd gimli

Checkout the current sources for libgimli:
    
    svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/libgimli/code/trunk

Getting necessary and optional external libraries. 
We need suitesparse and triangle. If they are not installed system-wide we provide a small script to obtain them.

    cd trunk
    cd external
    make 

Check if there are now a lib and an include path. With some content in it (e.g. libtriangle.a and libcholmod.a)
Then you can go back to the main gimli path:
    
    cd ../..
    
#### Dependencies for python bindings ####

Python bindings are generally a good idea because some tools depend on it. 
If you just want the libgimli library you can skip this part

The python binding files are generated automatic by using gccxml, pygccxml and pyplusplus
If you cannot install them with your distribution we provide a script for it.

    cd ..
    sh gimli/trunk/python/buildScripts/buildToolChain.sh

if 'sh COMMAND.sh' complains about missing pushd or popd try 'bash COMMAND.sh':

    bash gimli/trunk/python/buildScripts/buildToolChain.sh


##### Building with cmake #####

We test a new build system using cmake http://www.cmake.org/ that hopefully avoid a lot of problems from the past.
In the first, cmake provide out of source build so we recommend using a build directory beside the trunk path:

    cd gimli
    mkdir -p build
    
the main directory structure should looks like this:

    gimli/trunk
    gimli/build

change to the build path:

    cd build

and configure the build:
    
    cmake ../trunk

If the output complains some missing dependencies you want to install .. just install these and repeat the the last step. 

To build the library just run make
    
    make

The libraries will be installed in build/lib and some test applications are installed in build/bin

If you want to build the python bindings call
    
    make pygimli

the _pygimli_.so library will be copied into the source path ../trunk/python/pygimli. 
And some useful python apps will be 

You can test your build:

    make check

Of course the test will be very silent if you don't have cppunit installed.

If you have doxygen installed, you can create the api documentation:

    make html

#### Installation on Windows ####

##### Windows i.e. Mingw systems #####

First install mingw and msys to get a proper gcc an and the msys console

mingw-4.5.0 & msys-1.0.15
    automatic installer: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
    tested: mingw-get-inst-20100909.exe
    
The installation is common to the linux way with some small differences.

Prepare the directory structure like described above:
If you don't have a proper boost installation you can install them yourself:

    sh glimli/trunk/python/buildScripts/buildBoostWin32.sh

The build is performed via cmake. While calling cmake *Mingw* users should be preferable generate for msys makefiles:

    cmake -G 'MSYS Makefiles' ../trunk

cmake provide an interactive configuration and fine tuning, e.g., for adjusting the boost-include and boost-library paths.

    cmake-gui ../trunk #for MS Windows user

To build the library just run make
    
    make

##### Using cmake with CodeBlocks #####

First, for sure, you need codeblocks
    from: http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26
    tested: codeblocks-10.05-setup.exe
    change codeblocks toolchain (setting/Compiler & Debugger../) 
        to c:/mingw or MinGW64 base directory

to come ....

#### Example Installation on Ubuntu ####

    mkdir -p ~/src
    cd ~/src


-- deprecated ------------ 
Add boost include path to the build:

Step by step: what I did on vanilla win7-64bin:
win7-64.prof, gcc-4.6.1, boost-1.48.0, python-2.7.2	

install:
	mingw (mingw-get-inst-20111118.exe) (toolchain)
	TortoiseSVN-1.7.4.22459-x64-svn-1.7.2 (libgimli sources)
	>=cmake-2.8.7 (blas, lapack, gccxml)
	python-2.7.2 (python binding, boost)
	codeblocks-10.05-setup
	http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download (cmd-line tool for pygccxml)
--- reboot ---

adjust ~/.profile:

> export PATH=/c/python27:$PATH

choose an installation path
e.g.: (note, path might be created first)
> cd /c/user/$USER/src

Getting libgimli sources:

> svn co https://libgimli.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/libgimli/trunk libgimli

Install third party dependencies: triangle, suitesparse

> cd libgimli/externals
> make

Install third party dependencies: blas, lapack

> cd libgimli/externals
> make lapack

copy blas and lapack into libgimli/mingw path (why should we??)

Install third party dependencies: boost
	
> wget -nc -nd http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.48.0/boost_1_48_0.tar.gz
> tar -xzvf boost_1_48_0.tar.gz
(maybe some errors using tar at command line, choose total commander etc. instead)

fix boot sources that boost-python can be build

> sh libglimli/python/buildScripts/buildBoostWin32.sh

copy libboost-threads into libgimli/mingw path (why??)

build libgimli.dll by using codeblocks

> sh libglimli/python/buildScripts/buildToolChain.sh

build pygimli
