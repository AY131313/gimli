        an open-source multi-method library for solving inverse and forward tasks
-----------------------------------------------
BUILD (Windows systems)

Please look into the directory mingw and the README file therein

BUILD (for posix systems such as Linux, Unix, MacOS):

For the first time after initial svn checkout:

./autogen.sh
make

If you install from source-package
./configure
make

After further svn update:
make 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL EXTERNALS:

for the testsuite
cppunit (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit)

support for light-weight linear solver:
amd (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/amd/)
ldl (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/ldl/)

support for advanced linear solver:
blas                    
lapack                  
colamd                  
camd                    
cholmod                 
(http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/)

support for 2d mesh-generation:
triangle                

You can build triangle and suitesparse by calling the Makefile in the external directory

----------------------------------------------------------------
Windows toolchain:

mingw-4.5.0 & msys-1.0.15
    automatic installer: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
    testet: mingw-get-inst-20100909.exe
