Frist of all, **thank you** for submitting a pull request. We appreciate that you follow the spirit of open-source and that you are willing to contribute to pyGIMLi.

Please describe your implemented changes and make sure that you can check the following:

- [ ] This PR is targeted to the `dev` branch. If not, please [change this now](https://github.com/blog/2224-change-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request).
- [ ] `pg.test()` is still working (https://www.pygimli.org/dev#testing).
- [ ] New functions/classes have a docstring and preferably also a doctest (which is automatically checked with `pg.test()`). See an example [here](https://www.pygimli.org/dev#api-documentation-and-doctests).
- [ ] [Naming conventions](https://www.pygimli.org/dev#coding-rules) are followed.
- [ ] New code conforms to the [coding styles](https://www.pygimli.org/dev#coding-guidelines) such as PEP8 and others.
- [ ] (Not always necessary, but in `pg.testing` we collect additional tests that would go beyond the scope of docstring examples.)
