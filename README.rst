.. _sec:about_gimli_inversion:

Inversion
---------

GIMli solve ..

Please see :ref:`inversion tutorial<tut:inversion>` for examples and more details.

.. _sec:about_gimli_modelling:

Modelling
---------

Currently there are Finite Element Framework 
    * 1D, 2D, 3D
    * linear and quadratic shape functions (automatic shape function generator for possible higher order)
    * Triangle, Quads, Tetrahedron, Prism and Hexahedron
    * solve for elliptic problems

Please see :ref:`modelling tutorial<tut:modelling>` for examples and more details.
