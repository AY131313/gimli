    libgimli
        fixed bug in Mesh::createNeighbourInfos(). 
        Sometimes it could happen that a boundary got the wrong left or right cell. 
        Unsure if this played any role before. The correct right or left cell for each boundary is essential for gravimetric calculation using integration over boundaries.
    gravimetric:
        add very basic 2d gravimetric modelling based on cell or boundary integration.
        Boundary based is faster then cell based.

    libgimli
        add default --debug option to the optionmap that enables global --debug mode for all gimli.
        Currently spams a lot of memwatch messages, if available

    version bump -> 0.9.0
    internal change of jacobian storage. 
    Jacobian is now stored in forward modelling class.

    meshconvert.py 
        - add input support for *.mod(dc2dinvres), *.vtk, *.vtu(untested)
        - add interpolation into external coordinates to apply a 2D->3D transformation.
            --interpolateCoords=(file) file is a 3-column-ascii-file (dxy x y) to interpolate a 2D-mesh into 3D coordinates
