Installation directory for Windows systems using MinGW compiler

Prerequisites:
    for libglimli externals:
        cmake-2.8.7 (tested: 2.8.7)
        boost-1.48  (automatically installation via script (see below), tested: 1.47, 1.48, 1.49)

    for python bindings:
        python-2.7.2 (tested: )


What you need:
    A) A MinGW compiler suite
        download the automated installer (mingw-get-inst-*.exe) from 
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
      on Windows 7 download also the MinGW64 from 
        http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net
        and copy all binaries in x86_64.../bin into MinGW64/bin
    B) The platform-independent IDE Code::Blocks 
        download and install (release or nightly build) from 
        http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/
        set the executable toolchain to MinGW (Win32) or MinGW64 (Win64)
        
1. Install externals (Lapack,SuiteSparse and triangle)
    Open MinGW shell (Msys) and go to external directory
    call make (will download, unpack and build installation)
    In case of download errors:
        - check if wget command exists or install by calling
            mingw-get install wget
        - for problems with proxy server create file $HOME/.wgetrc
            http_proxy = http://<proxyserver>:<proxyport>
            proxy_user = <username>
            proxy_password = <password>
        
Build Toolchain:

    sh libgimli/trunk/python/buildScripts/buildToolChain.sh

    check for: "gccxml seems to work" otherwise .... contact me. (carsten)

    Build necessary boost_librarys:
    
    sh libgimli/trunk/python/buildScripts/buildBoostWin32.sh

    or 
	sh pygimli/buildScripts/buildBoostWin32.sh ../../
		
		
		
To build open Code::Block (testet with: 10.05 )

- File/Open or double-click on libgimli.cbp (codeblock project)
- Build/Build (CTRL-F9) builds the library (libgimli) itself
- do the same with the application cbp files or use workspace.

There are other codeblock projects for the individual applications
and several of these can be summarized in a workspace.

FAQ:
------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------

Code::Blocks failed with:
    cannot find -llapack_win32.dll
    cannot find -lblas_win32.dll

Copy the blas_win32.dll and lapack_win32.dll into the mingw path or to ../external/lib
You can optain a copy of these files from:

http://www.netlib.org/lapack/archives/

or
 
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xsvobod2/misc/lapack

or 

run in externals

make lapack
