In this directory all Python related things are located, i.e.:
- the pygimli library (python bindings of libgimli) itself in pygimli
- python tools directly linked to pygimli and therefore located in subdirectories of pygimli
- tests for pygimli located in tests
- ready python-based applications located in apps
- build scripts for building the needed tools (gccxml,pygccxml,pyplusplus,boost) in buildScripts

This directory should be added to the PYTHONPATH variable to call it from anywhere.

To build pygimli run 

sh build.sh

If something goes wrong (probably):

check for: 
	- valid gimli library in mingw (Win) or src/.libs (Linux)
	- gccxml, pygccxml, py++ installation
		There is an installation script in buildScripts/buildTollChain.sh. 
		If you want to install gccxml, please delete old installations and sources.
		Best way seems calling the aforementioned script with the prefix path
		as the same directory level as your gimli path 
		e.g.:
		sh buildScripts/buildToolChain.sh ../../../
	- boost: as needed for gimli too
