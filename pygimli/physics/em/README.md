Electromagnetics
================
This module contains different solutions for electromagnetic measurements over laterally layered (VTI) media in either the frequency domain (FD) or time domain (TD).

* FDEM sounding (ground or airborne) using VMD (or possible HMD) sources and receivers, e.g. RESOLVE airborne receiver or MaxMin ground system
* CSEM (FD) sounding with grounded bipole transmitter and magnetic (or optionally electric) field receivers
* TDEM sounding with loop responses (either impulse or step)







For 3D (or 2D) EM inversion, we refer to the packages custEM (Rochlitz et al., 2023) and SAEM.
